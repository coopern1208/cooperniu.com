git remote add origin https://github.com/cooperniu/cooperniu.github.io.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Access Your Website

Your website will be available at: `https://cooperniu.github.io`

**Note**: It may take a few minutes for the changes to be reflected.
